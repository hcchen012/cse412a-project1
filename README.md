# Project 1: Search in Pacman

In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

## Files edited:
search.py	Where all of your search algorithms will reside.
searchAgents.py	Where all of your search-based agents will reside.
